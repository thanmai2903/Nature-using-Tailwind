          <div className="mt-10 mb-10 sm:text-xs md:text-xl">
            Museo Nacional Thyssen stands out because of its nostalgic homepage,
            reminiscent of a bygone time. Between the classic font and the film
            playing in an oval shape, this website demonstrates how sometimes,
            you can’t go wrong by sticking with the basics. The site also stands
            out because of its excellent use of whitespace. As you navigate the
            homepage, parallax scrolling helps bring the story this museum is
            telling to life. Plus, it makes the user experience on the site more
            enjoyable.
          </div>
          <div className=" sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            Thanks to the neutral background color, this site has an excellent
            balance of video and copy, which never feels overwhelming. We also
            love how the site designer uses soft, curved lines to add a common
            thread throughout. The result is added continuity.

          <div className="mt-10 mb-10 sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            WCS also demonstrates how natural websites can excel. This site
            features a different style menu than others we’ve identified. WCS
            provides visitors with vertical navigation, which adds a unique
            style to the site. We love how, as you navigate through the pages,
            you’re never far from the menu. This makes it easy to browse the
            website and find what you want.
          </div>
          <div className="mb-20 sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            Another reason this website stands out is that it features visually
            different blocks on the homepage. This makes it easy to figure out
            where one section ends and another begins. And though these blocks
            do add some separation to the site, it all flows together well.

          <div className="mt-10 mb-10 sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            The Nature Conservancy also boasts one of our favorite natural
            websites. As you scroll through the site, you’ll notice that the
            implementation of parallax scrolling makes the entire experience
            more engaging. Additionally, we love how this site answers all of
            your questions directly underneath the large image, which grabs your
            attention when you land on the site.
          </div>
          <div className="mb-20 sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            The site also features a news section which makes finding recent
            updates easy. At the bottom, you are invited to see a local chapter
            to get involved. Another thing this website does well is providing
            visitors with a way to connect with the Nature Conservancy on an
            ongoing basis by providing your email. There’s also a clear CTA in
            the top right-hand corner: Donate.

          <div className="mt-10 mb-10 sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            Up next is Photoscoper. This is one of the best nature websites with
            a slightly different purpose than many others. Instead of raising
            awareness about conservation efforts, this site showcases the past
            work of a nature photographer.
          </div>
          <div className=" sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            One unique thing about this natural website is that the mouse
            distorts the background image as you move around, making it look
            like a piece of abstract art. You can press and release your mouse
            to open the site fully. When you do, audio of natural sounds plays
            lushly in the background.

            While the menu on this site is slightly different than many others
            on this list, it’s just as easy to navigate. The tabs are clear, and
            clicking them rapidly brings you to the next page you’re seeking.
            The transition between pages is also animated and visually
            attractive. This entire site is a feast for the eyes.

          <div className="mt-10 mb-10 sm:text-xs md:text-xl text-xs">
            GalataWind stands out as an excellent example of natural websites.
            The video background makes a visually gripping introduction to the
            site. It expands when you click the menu button in the top
            right-hand corner. Additionally, more copy pops up as you scroll
            down, making a compelling experience for visitors. One thing this
            site does exceptionally well is integrating motion — you’re never
            more than one scroll away from some form of video.

            While the font used throughout the Galanta Wind website isn’t too
            complicated, it does work well with the rest of the branding and
            offers a more engaging experience than a different, more popular
            font. We also love how this website features social media links at
            the bottom of the homepage in stylish bubbles.

              There are so many things that Visit Adirondacks does right. When
              you first land on this website, there’s a visually compelling
              loading page that gets visitors excited to be on the site. Visit
              Adirondacks features a robust menu that makes navigating the site

              Additionally, we love how the header copy pairs with the imagery,
              which changes in the background. As you scroll down, you are
              invited to learn more about different Adirondack regions, plus
              plan your trip. Finally, there’s even a newsletter signup section
              on the site footer.
